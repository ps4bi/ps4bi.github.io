To make a ".png" image with text but without background for the website logo, you can do as following.
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/logo.png)


1. Make a rectangle with desired size (no line/ no fill)
2. Add shadow layer, add desired text, chose size and bold style. Chose color is black (70%). This will be the shadow
3. Add front text layer. Duplicate the text in shadow layer, chose "White" color, shift near the shadow text.
4. Blur the shadow text: Move to shadow text, chose blur 2%
5. Export: Chose "Selection" to export only the text&frame(to obtain desired size), check the size (pixels), file
type (.png) then Export. Done!
